# Example using my-first-project - part two - writing code in library and rebuilding the project

## Adding dependencies

Next, we wish to add a function to our LibSplit.hs. The code is: 

~~~haskell
module Split.LibSplit where
	
mport Data.List.Split (splitOn)  -- from package split - split needs to go into dependencies in package.yaml to f


splitOnSpace ::  [String]
splitOnSpace  =  splitOn " " "hello there MAIREAD" 
~~~

Now, having saved the file,  we try to build again:

~~~
$stack build
~~~

This will give you an error: 
![Sample Error message](./img/09.png)

This is because of one of the new lines in *LibSplit.hs*

~~~haskell
import Data.List.Split(splitOn)    -- this needs to go into dependencies.
~~~

Split is an example of a library that needs to be explicitly locally installed. So we need to tell *package.yaml*

We need to add a 

~~~haskell
dependencies:
    - split
~~~
to the library section
(So now the library section looks like)

~~~
library:
  source-dirs: src
  exposed-modules: 
    - Lib  
    - Split.LibSplit
  dependencies:
    - split
~~~ 

Now,

~~~
$stack build
~~~

it should work. This will take a small while as split library is being downloaded.  Then run 

~~~
$stack install 
.. and
$my-first-project-exe
~~~

Note that we haven't called the *LibSplit* code so there's no change in what's returned.
