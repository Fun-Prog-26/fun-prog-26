# Parsing From CSV Example

This example is based on a Students  csv file. 
The stack package is [here](archives/csvCheck.zip).

You should look at the code, play around with the checks, see what happens when you change the data and then see how you will fit this into your assignment. Note the use of ***partitionEithers***
