# Parsing From CSV Example

This example is a minimum working example where you take data in from a csv file using a parser and generates  (possibly a formatted version of) a  markdown file. 
The stack package is [here](archives/GenFileMwe.zip).


You should look at the code, play around with the formatting of markdown, see what happens when you change the formatting.


For details on how to format a markdown file there is a Markdown Cheat Sheet  [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
