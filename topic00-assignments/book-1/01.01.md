# Lab Class test

Details of  lab class test 1.

## Aim

To test your level of competence with GHCI and basic Haskell

## When
This lab test will take place on Thursday, 6th February in class

## Marks
This will be worth 5%. 

## Task

I am looking at ways to give you the material but it will be in the same format as the sample zip file below. 

You will be asked to upload a zipped version of your changed files  through Moodle and asked to state that the work was your own (you can use any notes, internet, ghc material that helps you). 



A sample  exam is given [here](./archives/haskell_lab_test.zip)

(Note In both the sample exam and the actual exam that the prelude.hs file is for your information only - I have commented it out as you need to load the current version - this automatically happens if you *don't* have a local prelude.hs)
