# 3. Validation of Timetable

## Aim

Given a dataset of components of a timetabling system, 
identify issues and generate a report on changes needed and status of the overall dataset. 

***Note*** The example data that appears in this spec does not always include a primary key. You should ensure that there is a primary key for all entities and that any foreign keys are established.

## Detail of Validation at 'local' view

### `Lecturers` 

 - Lecturer's name no more than 30 characters. 
 - Available hours between 0 and 24


### `Groups` 
- size of group between 0 and 100


### `Rooms` 

 - capacity between 0 and 200

### `Modules`

- hours between 0 and 10

### `Programmes` 

- Programme name no longer than 40 characters



## Details of validation between entities

- Enforce unique primary keys rule 
- Ensure that any foreign key mentioned in one entity has the matching key in the linked entity.


## Details of validation of `Allocations`

 - Ensure that no lecturer has allocations totalling greater than their available capacity. 
 - Either assume that only one lecturer is assigned to any module or ensure that the number of hours allocation to a running of the module is as defined in the Modules entity. (This is not mandatory) 

## Details of validation in the generated timetable entity. 

***Note*** 
The timetable entity is the overall entity that brings all the components together. From this, we can generate 'publishable'  timetables at the following levels: 

- By group (for students)
- By lecturer
- By room



### Validations on timetable 


- There should be no clashes 
   - For groups (students should not be timetabled to be in two places at the one time)
   - For rooms (no room should have two different groups scheduled at the same time)
   - For lecturers (no lecturers should be scheduled to be in two places at the one time)

- A module should be fully timetabled. If a module has 5 contact hours, it should be scheduled for 5 distinct times. 

### Validations on timetable - possible extras (you can choose other extras)
 
- Students should have a lunch break
- Students should have one day with no lectures scheduled (if number of contact hours allow) 
- Lecturers should have a lunch break
- any other validations that you choose
