# 4. Generation of  documents and timetables

You are asked to generate reports on valid and invalid parts of the system entities:

## Individual entities
For each of your entities( e.g. Lecturers), you should generate two csv files 

- all valid lecturers
- all invalid lecturers 

## Generation of timetables
You can generate the timetables in whatever format you choose. You are asked to generate timetables at the following levels:
1. Group
2. Lecturer
3. Room

These documents may be generated without bespoke formatting or with such formatting. More marks will be given for bespoke, appropriate formatting. More marks will be given for extra documents. 

These documents can be any format you choose, e.g. .md, .docx (apart from csv). Check with me if you are thinking of any other format.
