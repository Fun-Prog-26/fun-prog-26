# 1. Timetable Validation

NOTE: This spec has not changed since the last version (apart from the handup date).

## Overview of  Assignment: 
You will be  tasked with writing a program that reads in elements of timetabling data. You are given sample codes in sample tables. These are starting points - they are enough but you may chose to a more detailed set of data.  You will be asked to validate a set of 'timetables' based on some rules that I list and some other ones that you may chose to add.

## Phase 1 of Assignment (optional)
For this phase, you  looked  at the looking at the design of the data, and writing some simple validations. The overview of the rest of the assignment is here:

###  Sample Data Set for full spec
A sample set of data that is needed for timetable validation is 


![](img/sample-data.PNG) 

Please note the data model underlying the sample data is very minimal and you may add to it. 

If we look at the sample data in two parts: 
 - the data that is mostly unchanging from semester to semester. 
 - allocations and timetable which change each semester. 

## Mostly unchanging data

Note that:

- The Modules,  Programmes and Rooms data are SETU wide information and will not generally change  from semester to semester;

- The Lectures data is also mostly unchanging apart from the available hours whih may change from semester to semester;

- The Group size may change from semester to semester. 


## Generated data

As part of preparation for a semester, the head of department will decide who should be teaching which modules. These decisions are presented as an allocations set of data (See Sample Allocations in diagram). 


A full set of data is published some of which will look like:

This, with all the other tables in the 'Mostly unchanging data' diagram are the main  inputs into the timetabling process. 

The timetable generating system should generate a 'valid' set of data such as in the 'Sample Timetable' diagram above. 



###  What do we mean by a 'valid timetable'? 

We will detail  the rules in the Validation tab, but some examples of what we need to check  are to ensure that:

 - no rooms are double booked
 - no groups of students are double booked
 - no lecturers are double booked
 - all of the hours of the module are timetabled

 etc. 

So you are asked to 

 - ensure that you understand the data 
 - ensure that any possible validations on fields (e.g available hours)
 - manually generate an allocation table (based on given samples)
 - validate the allocations (e.g. ensure each lecturer is not overallocated)
 - generate (manually at least) a timetable 
 - validate the timetable
 - generate a timetable per room
 - generate a timetable per student group
 - generate a timetable per lecturer
