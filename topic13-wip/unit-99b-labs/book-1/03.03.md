#Using trace in functions


##Exercise 1
Write a recursive function to calculate factorial. Use trace to see how it works.

##Exercise 2
The following sort is bugged. Using trace to help you, fix it. 

~~~

sort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
sort ( x : xs ) = insert x ( sort xs )
insert :: Ord a => a -> [a] -> [a]
insert x [ ] = [ x ]
insert x ( y : ys ) = if  x <= y   then (x : ys)   else y : insert x ( y : ys )

~~~
