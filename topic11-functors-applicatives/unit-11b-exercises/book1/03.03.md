# Lists

Looking at lists as Functors 

## Example 1
~~~
square :: Num a => a -> a
square x = x^2

-- using map as before
squareList1 :: Num a => [a] -> [a]
squareList1 xs = map square xs    -- can drop xs here (eta reduction)

-- using fmap functor
squareList2:: Num a => [a] -> [a]
squareList2 xs = fmap square xs   -- can drop xs here (eta reduction)

-- using <$> renaming for fmap (note now infix)
squareList3 :: Num a => [a] -> [a]
squareList3 xs = square <$> xs

~~~

## Exercise
Similar to above, write a function *add1* that adds one to a number. Then write three functions as above, using 
  
  - using *map*
  - using *fmap* 
  - using <*> 
 
 to write *incList1*, *incList2*, *incList3*
