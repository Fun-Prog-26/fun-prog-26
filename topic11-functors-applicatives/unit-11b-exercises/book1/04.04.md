# Using Maybe 
 - Simple example using Maybe

The following function 
~~~
-- Mapping a Maybe
squareMaybe :: Num a => Maybe a -> Maybe a
squareMaybe x = square <$> x

~~~

## Exercise 1
How would you call this to square a  (Maybe) value?  (Try it using one *Just* and one *Nothing*)

## Exercise 2
How would you write a *squareAllMaybe* function that maps this function over a list? Using

  - *map*
  - *fmap*
  - <$>

Practice calling this function on a few lists, e.g.

 - [Just 2, Just 4]
 - [Just 1, Nothing]


## Exercise 3 
Look at the following code: 

~~~
type Name = String

data Employee = Employee { name    :: Name
                         , phone   :: String }
                deriving Show
m_name1, m_name2 :: Maybe Name
m_name1 = Nothing
m_name2 = Just "Simon"

m_phone1, m_phone2 :: Maybe String
m_phone1 = Nothing
m_phone2 = Just "(087)999"

ex01 = Employee <$> m_name1 <*> m_phone1
ex02 = Employee <$> m_name1 <*> m_phone2
ex03 = Employee <$> m_name2 <*> m_phone1
ex04 = Employee <$> m_name2 <*> m_phone2

~~~
Before you run the code, try to calculate what the values of ex01 .. ex04 are. Then check your answer.
